## üñ•Ô∏è Technical Stack
### Backend:
Python (Flask): Flask is used to handle API routes, database connections, and user authentication. It provides a simple and flexible way to build scalable and maintainable web applications.

PostgreSQL: This relational database is used to store and manage data for users, content, comments, and categories. PostgreSQL ensures data consistency, scalability, and robustness.

### Frontend:
React.js: React.js is the core framework used to build the frontend of the application. It provides a dynamic and interactive user interface that is both efficient and scalable.

Redux Toolkit: Redux is used to manage the application's state, ensuring that data flows seamlessly between components, especially for managing user preferences, subscriptions, and notifications.

### Testing Frameworks:
Jest: Jest is a testing framework used for frontend testing, ensuring the React components behave as expected.

Minitests: Minitests are used for testing the backend API to ensure that the system functions as expected, validating everything from user authentication to content submission.

### Wireframes:
Figma: The platform‚Äôs UI/UX wireframes were designed in Figma, offering a clean and intuitive layout. Figma allowed  the team to collaborate on designing a responsive, mobile-friendly experience.
